    * DynUnion objects support the manipulation of IDL unions.
    * A union can have only two valid current positions:
    * <UL>
    * <LI>zero, which denotes the discriminator
    * <LI>one, which denotes the active member
    * </UL>
    * The component_count value for a union depends on the current discriminator:
    * it is 2 for a union whose discriminator indicates a named member, and 1 otherwise.
